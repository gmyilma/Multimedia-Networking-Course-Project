QR Triggered Photo Sharing Application forMuseums


For some historical or technical reasons it is not possible to take pictures in museums. This is eecause of the fact that in some way the camera, reflection might damage the quality of the pictures or Sculptureâ€™s, and some museums do not allow taking pictures at all. The idea of this QR Triggered Photo sharing application project is to create a means for museum visitors to have the experience of enjoying the pictures from the museum by developing an android application to decode a QR-Code encoded with the URL of the images in the museum, bringing low quality version of the picture for image filtering and sharing on social media. While sharing the URL of high quality version of the picture with the selected image filtering applied will be posted on the social media.  In addition, to create an interactive dashboard management web application for museum managers, to perform basic operations such as adding pictures, generating QR Codes and do some basic content management. We believe through this application both museums and visitors will benefit greatly, from the fact that it is easier for visitors to scan a QR Code than taking the best shots and for the museums, they will have some automated experience for their data in the museums and easily advertise themselves on the social networks.
